# Prompt BI ðŸ’¡

**Prompt BI** is a modern, web-based business intelligence application that allows users to upload, query, and visualize data using natural language commands.


## Features

* **Natural Language Commands**: Control the entire application through a simple, chat-like prompt interface.
* **Multi-Command Processing**: Execute multiple actions in a single prompt (e.g., "Load `sales_report.xlsx` and visualize profit by region").
* **Versatile File Support**: Load and analyze data from `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.txt` files.
* **Automated Insights**: Automatically generates a summary of key trends and statistics upon loading data.
* **On-Demand Visualization**: Generate bar, line, or pie charts in response to user prompts.
* **Natural Language Q&A**: Ask direct questions about your data (e.g., "What is the total sales?") and receive precise, calculated answers.
